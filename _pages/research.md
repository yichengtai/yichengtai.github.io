## Tau-Process for Nonproportional Hazards Scenario
In immunotherapy trials, the survival curves for treated and control show delayed separation or crossing survival curves because of the immune mechanism of human beings.

In addition, an addendum porposed by ICH suggests the estimand framework to report and interpret the results of clinical trials. Under nonproportional scenario, the commonly reported hazard ratio measure is meaningless.
