## Tau-Process for Nonproportional Hazards Scenario
In immunotherapy trials, survival curves for treated and control groups often exhibit delayed separation or crossing due to the human immune response. This phenomenon violates the traditional proportional hazards assumption in survival analysis, significantly reducing the power of standard testing procedures like the (weighted) log-rank test. Additionally, an addendum proposed by ICH suggests using an <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/ich-e9-statistical-principles-clinical-trials-scientific-guideline" target="_blank"> estimand framework </a> to report and interpret clinical trial results. Under nonproportional hazards, the commonly reported hazard ratio becomes meaningless. <a href=" http://www.oncoestimand.org" target="_blank"> Clinicians and biostatisticians in the pharmaceutical industry </a> are discussing a shift towards more interpretable treatment measures compared to the hazard ratio, log-rank test, and Cox model, in line with ICH guidance. We have proposed a novel approach for defining an interpretable estimand and developing the corresponding inference procedures. This methodology introduces a graphical Kendall's tau plot, effectively illustrating the relative performances of the two groups over time. The plot serves as an interpretable estimand for describing treatment effects and is advantageous because it is free of model assumptions and robust to censoring mechanisms.
